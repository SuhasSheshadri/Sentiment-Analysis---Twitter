# Sentiment-Analysis-Twitter
Analyse the tweets based on sentiment value of its words.

Mini Project:
We implement sentiment analysis on ”Sweden’s football journey during the FIFA World Cup-2018”
based on the tweets collected from Twitter. Our project shows the sentiments of people during the
whole world cup vs when Sweden lost matches. And also, the Term Frequency (tf) and Document
Frequency (df) for all the words form the tweets collected.
